I'm a final year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. My research has been on developing security frameworks for Smart-Grid/ICS Networks using Network Abstraction and Programmability. Most of my works involve [P4-programming](https://p4.org/) for network switches. I've worked on Hardware(Tofino) and Software(BMv2/Mininet) P4 switches. I work in the JinLab under [Dr. Kevin Jin](https://changeyourworld.uark.edu/directory/profile/uid/dongjin/name/Kevin+Jin/)'s supervision. 

In the summer of 2023, I was fortunate to have interned with [Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/research/network-fundamentals/) in the Network Architecture Research Group under [Meryem Simsek](https://www.nokia.com/people/meryem-simsek/) and [Jesse Simsarian](https://www.nokia.com/people/jesse-simsarian/) in Murray Hill, NJ. 

Prior to joining my Ph.D. I worked with Cisco, Nokia and Parallel Wireless in their mobile internet divisions qualifying 4G/5G network function softwares.
